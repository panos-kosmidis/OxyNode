Web Application's Starter Kit
=============================

The purpose of this kit is to easily start building front-end parts of web applications.

This project uses:

* HTML5 Boilerplate
* Twitter Bootstrap CSS & JavaScript
* Modernizr (full featured)
* Pretify lib (code highlighting)
* Chosen select boxes lib
* Jwerty for easy keyboard handling
* Bootbox for nice alert and confirm type boxes
* jQuery
* Backbone.js
* Underscore.js
* JSON2.js
* Require.js to apply JavaScript AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)
* QUnit for testings
* LESS Css files with less Node.js module for compiling
* Money.js as Node.js module
* Moment.js as Node.js module


Lot's of things are on their way.

Please if you think that any of the project's file violate any license please let me know if it does it's not on purpose and I will replace/remove or ask permission to use it.


What is planed
--------------
As I said, lot's of things are on their way some of those are documentation, examples and more features (I hope daily/weekly). 
Currently I'm working on DDD & CQRS implementation on the project with a different approach of Backbone.js models, the benefit is huge since DDD & CQRS provides great way to scale your application and teams to work together.

DDD and CQRS is almost implemented localy need's a bit of more testing and tuning and will be online soon (without examples unfortunately, I chose to let examples in the end because once functionality is there examples are not too much trouble to do)

Who should use it
-----------------

The purpose of this kit is to be used for web app's front-end development not for simple projects or websites because it could be too heavy for simple things, so if you believe that your project is too simple avoid this kit.
