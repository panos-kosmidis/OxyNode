Web Application's Starter Kit
=============================

The purpose of this kit is to easily start building front-end parts of web applications.

This project uses:

* HTML5 Boilerplate
* Twitter Bootstrap CSS & JavaScript
* Modernizr (full featured)
* Pretify lib (code highlighting)
* Chosen select boxes lib
* Jwerty for easy keyboard handling
* Bootbox for nice alert and confirm type boxes
* jQuery
* Backbone.js
* Underscore.js
* JSON2.js
* Require.js to apply JavaScript AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)
* QUnit for testings
* LESS Css files with less Node.js module for compiling
* Money.js as Node.js module
* Moment.js as Node.js module


Lot's of things are on their way.

Please if you think that any of the project's file violate any license please let me know if it does it's not on purpose and I will replace/remove or ask permission to use it.


Documentation, examples and more features will come (I hope daily/weekly)
